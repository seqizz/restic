Enhancement: Improve prune performance

We've improved the performance of pruning a repository.

Previously, restic would build a new index for the repository at the beginning
of the prune, do the prune, and then build another new index at the end.
Building these indexes could take a long time for large repositories, especially
if they are using cloud storage. Restic now loads the existing repository index,
keeps track of the added an removed packs, and writes a new index without having
to rebuild it from scratch. It also parallelizes as many operations as it can.

There is a new --ignore-index option to the prune command which makes restic
ignore the existing index and scan the repository to build a new index. This
option is not available for the forget command with the --prune option; restic
will always load the existing index when run in that manner.
