Enhancement: Add a command to copy a snapshot to another repository

We've added a copy command, allowing you to copy snapshots from one
repository to another.

Note that this process will have to read(download) and write(upload) the
entire snapshot(s) due to the different encryption keys used on the source
and destination repository.
